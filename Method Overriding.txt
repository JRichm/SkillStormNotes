Method overriding
	Method with the same signature as the one in a parent class
		public void speak() {}

	allows us to change behavior in a specialized class
	no matter the reference type, the right method is callled
		- thanks to virtual method invocation
	
	takes precedence over the superclass method	
		note: only non-static methods can be overriden

		class Animal
			void speak() {}
	
		class Dog extends Animal
			void speak() {}
