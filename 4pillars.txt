game plan

	object oriented programming
		reuse software in objects
		all of our code is written in classes
			used as blueprints
		used is lots of programming languages
	
		four concepts
			encapsulation
				take everything about an object, and put it in a class
			inheritance
				reuse classes
				child classes can act like parent class
			abstraction
				when we create a parent class that uses some common behavior
			polymorphism
				a way for object to change their behavior under different circumstances
				 
				
	
	procedural programming
		have to write code so it can be read from top to bottom
		lots of duplicate code
