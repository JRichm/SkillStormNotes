try block
	// read a single byte from a file
	try {
		FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
		f.read();
		f.close();
		log.info("Success!");

	} catch(IOException e) {
		log.info(e)
	}

finally block
	run after a try block - regardless if an exception is thrown
	useful for closing resources like files, network or databse connections, etc.
		try {
		} catch(Exception e) {
		} finally {}
	
	not to be confused with the final keyword
		- variable value cannot be changed
		- methods cannot be overriden
		- classes cannot be extended

	try {
		FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
	} catch(IOException e) {
		log.info(e);
	} finally {
		f.close();
	}
