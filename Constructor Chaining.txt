Every class in Java inherits from java.lang.Object
without defining a superclass, extends Object is implied
the first line of a constructor must be a call to super or this
	- super()

calling a constructor causes a chain of constructors to fire

	public JavaDeveloper() {}

	public JavaDeveloper(String name) {
		this();
	}
