constructors in java
	constructors initialize an objects state	
	calling the constructor creates an object at runtime
		- new keyword
		
	java provides default constructor
		only if you haven't provided your own

	you can define many constructors
		multiple constructors allowed
		one is required
		constructor overloading

methods in java
	method declaration
		public void go(int x, String y) { }

	method invocation
		object.go(10, "a");	
		arguments are what we are passing to the parameters


	public void go() {}				object.go();
	public void go(int speed) {}			object.go(100);
	public void go(int x, String y) {}		object.go(10, "A");

	static methods
		static methods are called without an object
			Math.Random();
			Math.pow(2,31);
			Math.tan(90;

		declare the mthod with the static modifier


	return types
		every method has a return type
		methods with non-void return type
			must declare another return type
			
			public int go() {
				return 5;
			}

		code will not compile without a return
