Linked List
	class in the collections API in java
	linear series of Nodes
		node wraps up a value (String, Pizza, etc.)

	"Linked" by a reference to the next node
	LinkedList is "Doubly-linked"
		nodes have a previous and next reference
	
	allows duplicate elements
	order of insertion is preserved

	the way linked lists are stored in memory is also different than array lists
		array lists
			elements/data is stored next to each other in memory
			if elements are removed or added, all elements after insertion must be moved so data stays together
		
		linkedLists
			elements do not have to be stored next to each other in memory
			each item in the list holds onto a reference/pointer to the next and previous item in memory
			references must be updated when adding or removing elements
