hashmap
	a class in collections API that stores key-value pairs
	the key is used to identify the value
	social security number maps to a US citizen
	key s must be unique, but there's no restrictions on values
	putting a value with the same key updates the value for that key
	underneath, HashMap stores "Entry" objects in an array
	your objects hashcode helps calculate the array index to store it in
	hashmap collision occur when the calculation for 2 indexes yield the same value
		java appends the entry to a linkedlist 

	if the linkedList gets too long, read operations are much slower
	reads are typically O(1) - constant time
	to maintain this, larger linkedLists (8+) are converted to red-black trees
		larger items are put on the right side

		    2   8    15

		when we are looking for a larger item, we dont have to traverse the entire left side of the list
