exceptions
	exeptional events that occur in the code at runtime
		reading a corrupted file
		network connection failure
		division by zero
		calling method without an object
	
	every exception has a type
		IOException	
		ConnectException
		ArithmeticException
		NullPointerException
		
		throwable
			exception
				runtime exception

			error

		checked exception inherrits from the exception class
			the JVM requires us to handle all of these exceptions before running our application	

		unchecked exceptions dirrive from runtime exception
			we dont have handle these for the program to run, but may cause problems while running
			usually come up from not following proper coding practices

		
	how the JVM handles exceptions
		exception is created inside the heap
		jvm looks for a handler inside the method that created the exception
		if none are found, the jvm will work its way backwards towards the main method to see if there is a handler for the exception
		if no handlers are found for the exception, the stack is finished
		the jvm will continue because there may be other stacks
		
		if the jvm finds a handler for the exception, the stack may continue
		the handler it is looking for is a try/catch block
			try {
			   // risky code
			} catch(ConnectException e) {
			   // recovery proceture
			}
