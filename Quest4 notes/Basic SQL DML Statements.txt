-- SELECT

	SELECT * FROM actor;

	   using the star (*) operator we can select all items from a table		


-- WHERE	

	SELECT * FROM payment
	WHERE payment_amount < '2.99';

	   using the WHERE statement, we can refine our search using comparison operators
		
-- BETWEEN

	SELECT * FROM film
	WHERE length
	BETWEEN 85 AND 115;

	   we can also use the BETWEEN keyword with the WHERE statement to select entries between two specified values


-- LIKE
	
	SELECT * FROM customer
	WHERE first_name
	LIKE 'M%';

	   the like statement allows us to use '%' and '_' as wildcards
		in the example above, we use the '%' operator to search for all customers whos first name starts with M
		we can use the '_' operator for single charachter wildcard

	SELECT * FROM customer
	WHERE first_name
	LIKE 'MAR_';

		this will return a list of four letter names that start with the letters 'MAR'


-- UPDATE

	UPDATE payment
	SET amount = 5.99
	WHERE payment_id = 5;

	   we can use the UPDATE statement to update data in a table using the SET keyword to specify a value
	   always use the where statement, otherwise the query will update every entry

-- DELETE

	DELETE FROM rental
	WHERE rental_id = 1;

	   we can delete entries from our table using the DELETE keyword
	   aways use the where statement when deleting entries, otherwise we could delete all entries of a table


-- ROLLBACK

	the ROLLBACK statement undos the last DML statement since the last commit

-- COMMIT

	the commit statements commits the changes and sets the changes in stone
