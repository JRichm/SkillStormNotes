relational model
	relational databases organize data into tables
	a table is also called an entity or a relation
	table defines the columns
	columns are also called fields or attributes
	we add rows to the table, which holds the data
	rows are also called records or tuples
		
	in oop terms:
		a table is a class
		a column is an instance variable
		a row is an instance (object)

	relational means tables can be related to each other somehow
		1:1 - one-to-one
			a student can have one identification card
			each identification card belongs to one student

		1:M - one-to-many
			a professor can teach many courses
			a course is only taught by one professor
		
		M:M - many-to-many
			a student can attend many courses
			each course can have many students

		in reality, a many-to-many relationship doesnt happen in a physical database
		we ususally use it to map out tables when we are designing tables
		to achieve a many to many relationship in our database we use a junction table, join table, or associative entity table

		entity-relationship-diagrams are used to design and visualize database management
