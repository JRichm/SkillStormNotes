data definition language

-- CREATE TABLE

	create a new table and assign column data types

		CREATE TABLE hero(
		   hero_id SMALLINT AUTO_INCREMENT,
		   hero_name VARCHAR(255),
		   hit_points SMALLINT,
		   attack SMALLINT,
		   defense SMALLINT,
		   PRIMARY KEY(hero_id)
		);

			in this example, we set the primary key on the last line of the query
			we can also set the primary key on the same line we assign data the data type
				CREATE TABLE hero(
				   hero_id SMALLINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
				   ...
				);


-- ALTER TABLE

	edit table after it has been created

	add columns
		ALTER TABLE hero
		ADD COLUMN magic_points SMALLINT;

	edit column names
		ALTER TABLE hero
		RENAME COLUMN magic_points TO mana_points;


-- DROP TABLE

	used to remove a table definition and all the data, indexes, triggers, contraints and permission specifications for that table

		DROP TABLE HERO;
		 
	you cannot use transaction control statements like ROLLBACK to revert a table DROP
	
	not usually used in a production environment


-- CONSTRAINTS
	
	used to limit what data can be entered into a column

		ALTER TABLE hero
		MODIFY hero_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE;
		
			this query updates the hero_name column to make it so that each time we want add a hero to the table
			we must enter a hero_name and it must be unique


	PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN_KEYs are also considered constraints


	NOT NULL	- 	must contain data
	UNIQUE		-	no duplicate values
	UNSIGNED	-	not negative	
	CHECK (column_name > 0)	makes sure data fits conditional
	FOREIGN KEY	- 	references other table

		
		ALTER TABLE hero
		ADD FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
		REFERENCES customer(customer_id);

			this query addes a foreign key relationship to the the hero table on the customer_id column
			makes it so that it references the customer_id column in the customer table

	most of these constraints can be added in the create table statement.


-- REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY
		
	if we are referring one record to another, then the parent record must exist
		we cannot delete countries without deleting the cities referring to those countries first
