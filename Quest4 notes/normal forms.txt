Normalization
	Normalization reduces data redundancy to save disk space
	reduces the change of data anomalies (inaccuracies)
	each stange in the process of normalization is called a normal form
	most databases use one of the following
		Second Normal Form (2NF)
		Third Normal Form (3NF)
		Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

1NF  -  defines a key for our tables

	No repeating groups (multi-valued column)
		only one value per column

	table must define a primary key
		a unique identifier for a row
	
	given a data set, you find candidate keys
		a reasonable choice for a primary key
	
	if none exist, create one - called a surrogate key

2NF  -  everything in the table has to be determined by the whole key and not part of it

	functional dependence 
		one value determines another
		your birthday determines your age
		order number determines the date the order was places
		first name does not determine anything

	composite key	
		two or more column primary key
	
	no partial dependencies
		a column determined by only part of the primary key

3NF  -  columns can only be determined by the key and nothing else

	no transitive dependencies
		a column determined by a non-key attribute
	
	includes derived attributes, which should be calculated
		your birthday determines your age
		item price times quantity determines line total
		sum of line totals determines the order sub-total

	edgar f Codd released his landmark paper in 1970
		a relational model of data for large shared data banks


	known as the father of the relational database model
	Mnemonic for remembering the normal forms
