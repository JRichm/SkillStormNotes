Bubble sort
	basic (not very efficient) sorting algorithm
	sort numbers from least to greatest
	good introduction into alorithms in general
	sortds data by comparing adjacent elements
	pushes higher number to the end
	they higher numbers "bubble" up
		
	time complexity
		big o-notation
			an algebraic equation that represents the time complexity
		each number (N) is compared to every other number once
		O(N * N) == O(N^2) == O(N squared) 
			inefficient

		find the largest integer?
			start from the beginning
			store the largest element
			go through each element and check each one once
			update largest variable if new element is larger
			this method has a time complexity of O(N)
			only goes throught the array and each element once
